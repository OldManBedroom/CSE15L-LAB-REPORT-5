[cs15lwi23ald@ieng6-203]:skill-demo1-server:486$ grep -r Rogativa
skill-demo1-data/written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions. Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay. After a short distance you’ll arrive at the western wall and a small square, Plazuela de la Rogativa, with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession, or rogativa, that saved the city in 1797. It’s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived. The British fled empty-handed.
skill-demo1-data/written_2/travel_guides/berlitz2/PuertoRico-WhereToGo.txt:Walk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall, which rises over 100 ft (301⁄2 m) at this point. The plain façade is broken by the San Juan Gate, which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port. The gate was constructed in 1639, and the walls were completed in 1641. Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passage — many would make their way directly to the Cathedral to give thanks for a safe arrival — and all goods were transported through here. The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight; they were locked and guarded each night but now remain open to allow people to stroll along the seafront.
